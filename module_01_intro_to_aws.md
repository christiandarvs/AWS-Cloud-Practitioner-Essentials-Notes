# Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services

AWS offers different services related to technology such as: Storage, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and etc.

**Client-Server Model**: The client (user) sends a request for data or services, and the server processes the request and sends back a response. 

**Example**: For example, when a user wants a White Chocolate Mocha, the client sends a request to the server (Amazon EC2). The server receives the request, verifies it (checks if payment is made), and then processes the request by preparing the drink (data/service) and sending it back to the client.

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: Virtual server

## Cloud Computing
A cloud service that provides different IT demands, such as computing power, databases, and storage, via the internet with a pay-as-you-use pricing model. The cloud service provider **(Amazon Web Services)** does the heavy lifting for you. The user has the choice of which option to choose: deployment type or size of computing resources. Access what you need, and only pay for what you use.

## IT Deployment Models
| Deployment Model        | Description |
| :--------------------- | :--------: |
| Cloud-Based  |  You can migrate existing applications or build new ones directly in the cloud, using either low-level infrastructure or high-level services. All parts of the application will run in the cloud.|
| On-Premises  | Resources are deployed on physical servers and managed using virtualization and resource management tools. This setup provides the ability to allocate dedicated resources. It is similar to legacy IT infrastructure but attempts to improve resource utilization through modern technologies.  |
| Hybrid     | It bridges the infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. This enables expansion and growth while connecting cloud resources to the internal system.| 

## Cloud Computing Models
| Cloud Model        | Description | Example |
| :--------------------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  | IaaS is a cloud IT service that offers networking, computers, and data storage, providing flexibility and management control over IT resources, similar to existing IT resources. | AWS, Azure, Google Compute Engine
| SaaS (Software as a Service) | SaaS vendors offer third-party software applications, such as web-based email, which are managed by the vendor, eliminating the need for maintenance or infrastructure management. This allows users to focus on using the software, eliminating the need for feature additions or server maintenance. | Gmail, Slack, MS Office 365 |
| PaaS (Platform as a Service)        | PaaS vendors eliminate the need for organizations to manage infrastructure, allowing focus on application deployment and management, reducing resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, and patching. | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Red Hat Openshift, Google Kubernetes Engine |
